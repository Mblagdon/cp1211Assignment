        <h2>What is Hockey?</h2>
        <div>
        <p><b>Ice hockey is a contact, team sport typically played in the winter months,
            and is usually played inside an ice hockey rink.</b> Ice hockey has two 
            teams compete against each other in a 6 vs 6, with 5 players and 1 goalie 
            on each side, while following the approproate rules, to try and score more goals then the opposing team.
            This is done by using each team using hockey sticks, and skating with the puck to put it in the oppositions net.
            Ice hockey consists of 3 periods, an over-time if there is a tie after the 3 periods, and a shoot out if there 
            is a tie after the overtime. The length of the periods differ depending on the league, however in the NHL regular season
            there is 3, 20 minute periods with a stop clock, followed by a 5 minute 3 vs 3 overtime, and then a shootout. These 
            are then changed in the playoffs for 3, 20 minute periods with stop clock, with continuous 5 vs 5 20 minutes overtime until
            a team is able to score, ending the game.
            The biggest league in the world that plays ice hockey is known as the <b>NHL(National Hockey
            League)</b>, where 32 teams compete in an 82 game regular season, to advance to play in the playoffs
            for a chance to compete and win the Stanley Cup.
        </p>
        <p> Ice hockey was first played on March 3rd, 1875 in Montreal, Quebec, and in 1994 was offically
            made to be Canada's national winter sport. It is an unmixed sport, which means unless that hockey league
            specifically allows both genders to play together, they must play seperately in there own group within a
            league. This is normally done to prevent any unneccessary injuries, and to keep the game competeive and fun 
            for everyone involved.
        </p>
        <p>Although ice hockey is generally not co-ed unless that specific league states otherwise, hockey is meant for 
            all skill levels and ages. The women's leagues are very highly skilled and competetive, just like the mens leagues.
            The womens hockey is becoming more popular to watch and is developing more and more each year. <q>People would say, ‘Girls don’t play hockey.
            Girls don’t skate.’ I would say, ‘Watch this’.</q> – Hayley Wickenheiser.
        </p>
        <p>
            A league will typically have rules in place for each level, such as the age group 
            for children learning to play could be ages 5-6 in one group, 7-8 in the next, and so forth. This allows the
            children to learn the rules and develop before playing with older children who will be more advanced in there 
            skills. A league will <i>typically</i> offer classes for players who are just starting out, no matter the age. This way
            the person can develop and gain some confidence before playing with players who have been enjoying the game for years.

        <!--What is a hockey rink?-->
        <center>
        <img src="hockeyrink.gif" alt="hockey rink makeup" width="750" height="400">
        </center>
        <h3>The Hockey Rink</h3>
        <p id="para1">Although a hockey rink can slightly vary in size and colors, there is a general rule of thumb for all rinks. As shown
            by the picture, there must be boards around the whole rink, two regulation size goalie nets, two players benches for the players not 
            currently on the ice, two penalty boxes for players assessed penalties, and a score keepers box for keeping track of the goals,
            penalities, shots and other vital information.
            A standard hockey rink must be 200 feet long by 85 feet wide, have a blue offside line for each team(meaning there 
            is 2 blue lines), a red center line, red faceoff dots for each possible faceoff(8 red faceoff dots), and a red goal line on
            each end of the ice. There will be two goalie creases, one by each goalie net.
        </p>
        <!--Equipment needed-->
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>Depending on if the person playing is a skater or a goalie will determine what equipment that person will require. Here we
            show what each position will need! The sizing of each piece of equipment will depend on the size of the person wearing it,
            always consult with experienced personnel when determining if the fit is correct.</p>

        <img src="hockeypositions.png" alt="positions of hockey players" width="750" height="400">
        </center>
        <h3>Team Positions</h3>
        <p>Each hockey team has multiple positions that can be broken down into 3 categories. These 
            categories would be as followed:
        </p>
        <h4>Forwards</h4>
        <p>A forward is responsible for trying to score on the opposing team. The forward role is broken
            down into three different positions. These positions would be the Right Wing(RW), the Center(C)
            and the Left Wing(LW). The right wing will cover the right side of the hockey rink,
            the center is responsible for taking faceoffs and covers all areas of the rink as a support player, 
            while the left wing covers the left side of the hockey rink.
        </p>
        <h4>Defencemen</h4>
        <p>A defencement is responsible for trying to prevent the opposing teams forwards from having quality
            scoring chances and shutting down the other teams forwards however possible. A defencemen position
            is broken down into either a Left Defencemen(LD) or a Right Defencemen(RD). The left defencment will
            cover the left side of the ice while the right defencement will cover the right side.
        </p>

        <!--Team Members-->
        <h3>Team Members</h3>
        <p>An ice hockey team is generally made up of about 20 players, with the exception of extra
            players incase of injury. For the makeup of a team you would have 18 skaters and 2 goalies.
            This would breakdown into 4 lines of fowards(which would be 12 players), 3 lines of defencemen(which would
            be 6 players), and the 2 goalies. </p>
        
        <!--The officals-->
        <center>
            <img src="nhlref.jpg" alt="two referees and linesmen" width="350" height="200">
        </center>
        <h3>The Officals</h3>
        <p style="color:blueviolet; font-size: 18px";>In ice hockey there are generally 4 officals on the ice. The officals, often reffered to as "referees" or "refs",
            and linesmen, wear a black and white striped shirt. The only distinction is that there are 2 refs,
            and 2 linesmen, and the refs will wear an orange armband to differentiate from a linesmen.
            These officals are responsible for the control of the game, and making the appropriate in game calls as they 
            see them. A ref is responsible for supervising the game calling penalities and goals, and enforcing the rules
            of the game.The penalities called can range from 2 minute minors, 5 minute majors, to a 10 minute major with a game
            misconduct. They will conduct the face offs at center ice for the beginning of each period and after goals. The 
            refs are the only officals who may communicate with the coaches and scorers. The linesmen are there to watch for 
            rule violations such as offsides and icings. These officals cannot call a penatly, however they can report violations
            to the ref.
        </p>
        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <p class="center">There are many rules in the game of ice hockey that the referees are responsible for enforcing. Here is just a brief list
            of common rules that a referee has to pay attention for and call penalities on:
        </p>
        <u class="center">
            <li>High-sticking</li>
            <li>Fighting</li>
            <li>Boarding</li>
            <li>Hit to the head</li>
            <li>Tripping</li>
            <li>Slashing</li>
            <li>Interference</li>
            <li>Goaltender Interference</li>
            <li>Hitting from behind</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These rules can range from a 2 minute minor, 4 minute double minor, 5 minute major, and a 10 minute major plus game suspension,
            depending on the severity of the penalty. However, most penalities called will be a 2 minute minor, such as interference, tripping,
            and slashing. A 4 minute minor will be awarded when there is a minor penalty called, but there is blood drawn on the play. A 5 minute
            major is given when there is a fight between two players, and a 10 minute major plus game suspension is when there is a "dirty" play
            such as a hit from behind, or a hit to the head, or boarding. This penalty is issued when a player makes contact to another player while 
            a player is in a position where an injury is likely to occur. To see a full list of the penalities a ref may call, click on the following

        <!--Variations of hockey-->
        <div>
        <h3>Variations of Hockey</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Ice hockey is meant to be a team sport with the main focus being on inclusion. This means that the game has been adapted so that anyone
            is able to enjoy the great game in some capacity. Below is a list of a few vaiations of hockey with a brief explanation of each, while you
            can see other variations by clicking on the following link : <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hockey/hockey_variants.htm">Variations of Hockey</a>            
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pond hockey</li>
            <li>Sledge Hockey</li>
            <li>Ball Hockey</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Pond Hockey</h4>
        <p>Pond hockey is essentially the same as ice hockey that is played in a rink, however it is played outdoors on a frozen body of water. Pond hockey
            is considered a variation of hockey that allows for anyone to experience the game but taking away the expensive costs of equipment and cost of 
            a hockey league. All that is required for pond hockey is skates, gloves,a helmet and a stick. In pond hockey there is often not even a goalie 
            or a regulation net. Anything from bags, to shoes could be set up to be used as a net that the players would pass the puck through. The focus for
            this type of hockey is so that no matter how well-off someone may be, they can still feel included and get to enjoy a game of hockey.
        </p>
        <h4>Sledge Hockey</h4>
        <p>Sledge hockey is another example of how inclusive the game of hockey really is. Although sledge hockey is played in a rink due to the need for 
            the player to sit on a "sledge", it allows a person who does not have function of there legs to play the game. They will follow most of the same rules
            as ice hockey, with the exception of no contact, and they use two smaller sticks so that they can push off of the ice to gain speed.

        </center>
        <h4>Ball Hockey</h4>
        <p>Ball hockey is another great way of showing just how much people want to enjoy a game of hockey. Some people are unable to afford skates, even for 
            a game of pond hockey, or are just unable to skate for any type of reason. This is where ball hockey comes in. Ball hockey allows you to just use 
            a pair of running sneakers, gloves and a stick, and a ball. Helmets are typically only worn when played at a younger age. The concept of ball 
            hockey is still the same as ice hockey, except it is played on a floor instead of ice, and players run instead of skating. This has even been 
            adapted further into "road hockey", where they will play ball hockey on a parking lot, or in a driveway. This way everyone is able to play the great game.
